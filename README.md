Personal Python Startup File
============================

Python allows for a startup file to be run anytime you open a Python
interpreter. This one doesn't do a ton beyond colorizing the prompts.

On Linux, this can be managed (I believe) as a "regular" homeshick castle.

On Windows, clone the diretory, install the requirements, and then run
`load-windows.py`. The last script adds the appropriate key to the Windows
registry so the Startup file will be loaded. The cloned repo will need to
remain on disk.
